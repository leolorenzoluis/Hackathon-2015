						SHIELD uses data from the openFDA API based on the FDA's electronic database of drug labels. openFDA is a beta research project and not for clinical use. While we make every effort to ensure that data is accurate, you should assume all results are unvalidated. Neither this site nor the FDA ensure or warrant the efficacy or safety of medication available "over-the-counter".
