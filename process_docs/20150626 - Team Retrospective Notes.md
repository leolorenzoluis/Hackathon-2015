##Team Retrospective Notes

Things to improve:
- Making more structured decisions for each sprint / having sub-sprints to allow a product backlog to build up
- Follow the agile process â€“ need a clear scrum master, as well as a product owner making functional decisions
- Have a full-time resource allocated to front-end design
- Focus on documenting what the team is doing more, instead of fleshing out future user stories that may never be prioritized
- If more prep time is allowed, set up the technology stack better beforehand
- Establish backups for each team member assigned to these ad-hoc projects, so that existing projects are not substantially impacted
- Research an alternative mockup tool to Balsamiq to hold usability testing before the code is ready
Things that went well:
- Team co-location improved communication, reduced distraction vs. cubicles
- Challenging project different from the regular day-to-day of an ongoing project
- Learning new technology, FOSS alternatives to existing tools
- Having design deliverables online/easily accessible (Trello, Github)
